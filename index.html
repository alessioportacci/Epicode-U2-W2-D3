        <h2>Who are the Psychonauts&trade; ?</h2>
        <p>
          The Psychonauts are an elite group of international secret agents who
          work with the federal government to keep peace around the world. They
          also investigate Unregistered Paranormal Entities, among other duties
          relating to psychic research. Most members, though not all, have
          psychic abilities. Their headquarters is called the Motherlobe, which
          is located in what used to be the largest Psitanium mine in the world.
          Truman Zanotto is the current grand head of the Psychonauts, and
          Hollis Forsythe is its second, or "lesser" head.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Psychonauts were founded by the Psychic Six, a group of experts of
          the paranormal led by Ford Cruller. They were called in by the
          international community to deal with genocidal psychic named Maligula,
          who was on a rampage determined to flood the country of Grulovia. The
          Psychic Six agreed to fight Maligula, and after a long battle they
          managed to defeat her. With Maligula believed to be dead, the
          Psychonauts were officially founded and were given their own base of
          operations known as the Motherlobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Psychonauts then recruited various psychics from around the world,
          and became a group of international psychic espionage, and most of
          their adventures were reported in True Psychic Tales, albeit with a
          few creative liberties. The Psychonauts then set up Whispering Rock
          Psychic Summer Camp, in order to train psychic children to control
          their powers, while also preparing potential future agents. The camp
          then became one of the Psychonauts main sources of income.
